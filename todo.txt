TODOs
- CITL
- Postprocess images
- Gamma correction/log scale

FIXMEs
Why does Neural Holography fail?
- ROI?
- Setup?
- Propagation distance? 20 cm?
- Other assumptions?
Can Linux be used for CITL?
- Yes: Raspberry Pi
- No: My laptop using Windows

Notes
- Lookup how the scaling works in holoeye -> manual paper
- Fix orientation of slm -> manual LC-2012-Manual, hdmi should be on the right
- Fix polarization going into slm -> manual, plus is on the rights, -> 315° gets -45°
- Fix wavelength -> manual paper, 532 um

- GS leads to random looking patterns
- Plug Holoeye pattern into waveprop or Neural holography
- SLm patterns are not unique, different slm pattern can result in the same image plane patterns
- HDMI might do some non linear stuff because it is made for humans (shouldn't impact, we used the same code)
